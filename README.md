# Nexus

A discrete-event network simulator designed to make testing application code
simple by leveraging a filesystem interface for modeling point-to-point and
shared channels. Performs high-fidelity emulation using Linux-cgroups to
precisely monitor and control the amount of CPU time each process gets.

Documentation to come! As this project is still in the earlier stages, APIs
are in flux and so it doesn't make sense to thoroughly document them yet.
